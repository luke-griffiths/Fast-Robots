# Lab 9

The purpose of this lab is to implement a very simple PID to control the angular speed of the robot. This will allow me to capture distance measurements as the robot spins in place. 
Arrays of measurement data can then be combined to form a map of the robot's environment. 

## PID
For this lab, I exchanged my PID for a much simpler version. Previously, my implementation was 
```
PID(float setpoint, float currentPoint){
  //calculate the error
  float error = setpoint - currentPoint;
  //calculate terms
  float p = Kp * error;
  integral
  += error * dt:
  float i = Ki * integral;
  float d = Kd * (error - previousError)/dt:
  float output = p + i + d;
  //update previous error
  previousError = error:
  return output; 
}
```
which was then fed into a complicated clamping function to ensure the motor values didn't exceed 255 or fall below 0; however, since I just wanted to keep the robot spinning
in place at 20 degrees per second, I experimented and found that a PWM value of 75/255 was around 20 degrees/sec. I then used the value of 75 as my setpoint.
```
int setpoint = 75;
int simplePID(){
    //aim for 18 measurements per rotation
    int error = 20 - myICM.gyrZ(); //the axis (x,y,z) needs to be changed if the IMU orientation is changed
    int motorVal = Kp * error;

    analogWrite(0,0);
    analogWrite(1,setpoint + motorVal);//right wheel forward
    analogWrite(2,setpoint + motorVal);//left wheel backward
    analogWrite(3,0);

}
```
Below is a video of the car spinning in a circle at the setpoint of 75. It's spinning much faster than 20 degrees per second here because the surface is slippery, 
but you can clearly see that the robot stays roughly in the exact same position while spinning. If I wanted the car to slow down enough to be useful on this surface, I would need to make Kp much larger.

I then created an interrupt function so that I would only take a distance measurement every 20 degrees (1 second). 
```
void sensorInterrupt{
    if (millis() - prevTime > 1000){
        distanceArray[i] = distanceSensor.getDistance();
        prevTime += 1000;
        i +=1;
    }
}
```
This made it much easier to keep deal with the data, and ensured that I only collected 18 data points.
