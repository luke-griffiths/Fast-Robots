# PID Control
The purpose of this lab is to implement and tune a PID controller for the car that is capable of stopping the car 300mm from an object in its path. 
The simplest part of this lab was the actual PID implementation. The bulk of time spent in this lab was either developing the bluetooth commands to send data between
the computer and the car or analyzing the car sensor data to tune the PID constants.
