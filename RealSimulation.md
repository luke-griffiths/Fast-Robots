# Lab 12

## Simulation
The first step of this lab is running the simulated localization notebook, which uses Vivek's simulation to show the robot doing localization in the map. 
The screenshot below shows the robot's simulated localization results. The red trace is the odometry model's prediction, the blue trace is the belief using the Bayes filter, and the green is the robot's ground truth.
